UNTRACEABLE AND POSSIBLE TO USE ON LEGIT VERSION, BEST *CHEAT* RIGHT NOW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows to kill the boss or roll the RNG dice (like event) and reload every 10-20 sec or so.
Only way to guess if someone's cheating is weird behaviour, like with old speedhack but much much much harder to spot.
Get virtual machine, VMWare is a way to go but the option is premium so either pay $ or crack it.
We will then use the option to snapshot to save/load bypassing any need for softwares or memory reading shit.
Works with kload, for interested you can even use it on bot if special precautions have been taken. With replay editing
you can even use it on official game and just juggle it as ,,everybody getting DC but me" to take the mat.
Idea to cheat by save/load was there for a long time, the only difference is that I found a way to actually get save/load option about 4 years ago.

Any of those serial keys should work:
FZ5X2-DKYE2-H88TP-3DQZC-YYUG6
CY54K-0DWEP-H89DZ-F4PGX-YFUZ2
ZG1RK-4PZ94-0809Z-2QQNV-Q62W0
ZC55U-2QXDH-M80AZ-CZQZT-XF8A6

Now you need any OS to run wc3 on, ofc best choice being windows:

Download fresh wc3, 1.28.5 is good enough for SP:

Safe known things affecting RNG:
Boss position
How you killed it
Time

Perfect example of replay as proof, naked knight lvl 420 getting best items possible when you could only spawn 1 boss each in just 1 replay. Need wc3 version 1.28.5 (ALSO IN FOLDER):
